We use Continuous Integration and Delivery (CICD) for this project.

This project has CICD established via our [Jenkins server](https://is-nts-jenkins.uoregon.edu).

> TODO: Before using CICD for your project, there are some one-time setup steps for establishing CICD for your project via our Jenkins server.
> Those setup steps are outlined at the end of this document.

> â„¹ We plan to transition to using GitHub Actions in the future to replace Jenkins.

Simply complete the 'Deployment Checklist' to deploy your project to its Python Package Index.
The checklist, which includes the 'Deployment Workflow', 
It is really quite a simple workflow!

## Deployment Checklist

Before delivering a new version of this package, these are key steps.

- [ ] Update declared dependencies, if needed.
- [ ] Ensure all existing automated tests pass.
    - [ ] **BONUS POINTS**: Ensure code coverage of any new code.
        * E.g. `hatch run dev:coveragee` will produce "htmlcov/index.html" report.
- [ ] Ensure any production functionality has not regressed (best effort).
- [ ] Update the version, following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
    * E.g. `hatch version patch|minor|major`
- [ ] Update Release Notes, to include the new version.
- [ ] Update the User Guide with any relevant changes.
- [ ] Complete the [Deployment Workflow](#deployment-workflow)
- [ ] Once the package is in PyPI, ensure you can download and install the new package version successfully.

## Deployment Workflow

Our Continuous Integration and Delivery (CICD) are triggered by Pull Requests.
The workflow to trigger a new deployment is the very simple pull request workflow (annotated with CICD steps):

1. **`git push`** your new branch to the Source Control Management (SCM) server.
2. Log in to the SCM server and **create a pull request**.
    * Continuous Integration (CI) runs at this point (running all automated tests).
3. Once Jenkins has completed its CI run, **merge** the pull request
    * Continuous Delivery (CD) runs at this point (deploying to the appropriate Python Package Index)
